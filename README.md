# HanoPCs SQL Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes real PC sales data using SQLite and SQL to evaluate profitability, pricing efficiency, and time-to-sale for a small PC reselling business.

## Dataset
- 20 PC sales from March–July 2024  
- Sale dates were approximated due to missing timestamps  
- Metrics include price, cost, profit, and days-to-sell

## Key Questions
- How long do PCs take to sell on average?
- Does higher profit impact time-to-sale?

## Key Findings
- Average profit per PC: ~$180  
- High-margin builds (>$200) averaged $242.58 in profit  
- Average time-to-sale was ~5 days  
- Higher margins did not meaningfully increase selling time

## Tools
- SQLite
- SQL
- DB Browser for SQLite
